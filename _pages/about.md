I'm a Master's student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) supervised by [Jiarui Ding](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jiaruid/). I completed my undergraduate degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I worked with Professor [Michael M. Hoffman](https://hoffmanlab.org/).

My research interests are in developing computational tools for single-cell sequencing data. I also love teaching computer science as I have been a TA for a plethora of courses at UofT and UBC.

*As I have not taken a professional photo of myself yet, please enjoy middle school me*.
