I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) supervised by [Jiarui Ding](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jiaruid/).
I completed by Master's degree in the same department in 2024.
I completed my undergraduate degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I worked with Professor [Michael M. Hoffman](https://hoffmanlab.org/).

My research interests are in developing computational tools for single-cell sequencing data.
Currently, I am working on machine learning for various single-cell -omics, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, and multiomics.
I also love teaching computer science as I have been a TA for a plethora of courses at UofT and UBC.

*If you are an undergraduate student at UBC looking to conduct research in computational biology, you can reach out to*
*myself or Professor Ding. We may have interesting projects for you to work on.*
