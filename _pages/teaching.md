I will be teaching CPSC103 in 2024W2!

I have been a TA for CPSC103 and CPSC121.
Within CPSC103, I have been heavily involved in integrating PrairieLearn and autograding into the course.

Recently (September 2024), I worked on developing materials for the department's TA training program with Jordon Johnson.

Back at UofT, I was a teaching assistant for the following courses:

* CSC148H1
* CSC165H1 three times
* CSC236H1
* CSC373H1
* ESC180H1 twice
* ESC190H1 three times
